# Exploiting the CI/CD Attack Surface: A Deep Dive into Gato-X

## Chapter 1: Introducing Gato-X - The GitHub Attack Toolkit

In the world of DevOps, GitHub Actions and workflows have become the backbone of automation. However, this power introduces a complex new attack surface. **Gato-X** (GitHub Attack Toolkit) is an open-source reconnaissance and exploitation tool written in Python, designed specifically to probe and weaponize this surface.

At its core, Gato-X is a Swiss Army knife for assessing GitHub security. It answers critical questions after a token is compromised:
*   **Reconnaissance:** What can this token see and access?
*   **Enumeration:** Where are the misconfigurations, particularly in CI/CD pipelines and self-hosted runners?
*   **Exploitation:** Can we leverage these misconfigurations to escalate access and steal secrets?

It automates the tedious process of manually constructing GitHub API queries and crafting malicious workflow files, making it a powerful tool for red teamers, bug bounty hunters, and defensive blue teams alike.

## Chapter 2: The Anatomy of a Repository Takeover

Being a contributor to a GitHub repository is rather simple. You could make a pull request to fix a typo, or add some small log that looks meaningless and harmless. However by being merged it grants you certain privileges, one of the most powerful being the ability to create workflows. Gato-X automates the creation and execution of workflow payloads.

One of the most devastating attacks is the direct exfiltration of a repository's secrets. These aren't just passwords of small accounts, they can be Artifactory tokens, deployment credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure) or sensitive environment variables.

With write access to a repository, a single command can compromise its entire secret vault.

### The Attack in Practice

`gato-x attack --secrets -t targetOrg/targetRepo -d`

Let's break down what this command does:

1.  **Permission Check:** Gato-X first checks if your provided GitHub token has the necessary permissions (like `repo` scope and workflow write access to the target repository).
2.  **Malicious Branch:** It creates a new branch in the target repository, cleverly named to look innocuous.
3.  **Payload Deployment:** It pushes a malicious workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to this branch. This file contains code designed to dump all the repository's secrets during execution.
4.  **Execution & Exfiltration:** The tool triggers the workflow and then patiently waits for it to run. Once the job executes, the secrets are printed directly to the workflow logs. Gato-X can then capture this output and present the stolen secrets right in your terminal.

## Chapter 2.1: The Wolf in Bot's Clothing

Within large organizations, automation is key. It's common to find GitHub bots that handle tedious but necessary tasks, such as:
*   Checking for outdated dependencies.
*   Bumping library versions.
*   Creating pull requests with these minor, (presumably) safe changes.

For engineers maintaining dozens or even hundreds of repositories, manually merging these minor PRs every day is a soul-crushing task. The natural solution is to automate the approval process. A common pattern is to write a script that checks the author of a pull request; if it's a trusted bot like `dependabot[bot]` or `organization-ci-bot`, the script automatically approves and merges it, as long as it is a minor bump or no-impact to the repository.

This automation creates a massive trust vulnerability. What if you could simulate one of these bots?

If you compromise the credentials of a GitHub bot or can otherwise authenticate as one, you can create your own pull requests. An engineer's automation script, seeing the "trusted" author, would automatically merge your code without a human ever looking at it.

Your malicious code is now in the main branch of a production repository. Gato-X can help automate the creation of these seemingly harmless PRs. And the best part? This attack can be incredibly stealthy. Since you control the workflow run that created the PR, you can delete the log traces afterwards by using the workflow run ID, covering your tracks effectively.

## Chapter 3: The Persistent Threat of Non-Ephemeral Runners

The most critical vulnerability Gato-X exploits lies in the misuse of self-hosted runners.

GitHub's official hosted runners are **ephemeral**. This means after each job execution, the virtual machine is destroyed, taking any cached secrets or compromised state with it. This is a crucial security feature.

However, many organizations use **self-hosted runners** on their own infrastructure, often due to cost, specific hardware requirements, or network access needs. A common, yet severe, misconfiguration is to make these runners **non-ephemeral**. They are long-lived and reused for multiple workflow runs.

Gato-X specifically hunts for these vulnerable runners. The tool can execute a malicious workflow payload that establishes a reverse shell or provides an interactive console directly on the runner's host machine.

`gato-x a --runner-on-runner --target ORG/REPO --target-os [linux,osx,windows] --target-arch [arm,arm64,x64]`

The implications are severe:
*   **Secret Cache Poisoning:** The runner might have secrets cached in memory, environment variables, or configuration files from previous jobs.
*   **Persistence:** Since the runner is not destroyed, you can install persistent backdoors or mining software on the host.
*   **Lateral Movement:** This runner is likely inside the organization's internal network, providing a perfect launchpad for attacking other internal systems.

The most alarming aspect of this attack is that it can often be performed from a **fork** of the repository. If a repository has "fork workflows" enabled on its self-hosted runners, anyone on GitHub can create a fork of their code, write a malicious workflow, and have it execute on the organization's own, internal, non-ephemeral machines.

## Chapter 4: From a GitHub Token to Cloud Dominion

This article has outlined just a few ways a simple token can be leveraged. The initial compromise of a credential, perhaps found in a public commit, is only the beginning. Tools like Gato-X provide the blueprint for how an attacker can move from a low-privileged starting point to a position of significant control.

The final thought is a sobering one. The chain of attack doesn't stop at GitHub. Imagine what happens if a stolen secret from a repository is a service account token for a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud. An attacker can then use that cloud token to perform privilege escalation, potentially gaining control over all deployments, listening to logs, exfiltrating customer data, and creating persistent backdoors that are incredibly difficult to root out.

The security of your code is inextricably linked to the security of your infrastructure. Understanding and hardening your CI/CD pipeline and Github repository against tools like Gato-X is no longer optional... It's a fundamental requirement.
